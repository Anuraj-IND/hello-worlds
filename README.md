## Contributing

Want to contribute to our little project? Take a look at some of our existing
examples, take a crack at any language, and submit a pull request.

We are by no means experts, so if you see something that can be improved upon,
please let us know (or submit a pull request with the changes yourself)!

### Functionality

We haven't exactly established many rules, but here are some guidelines that we
are trying to adhere pretty strictly to with each implementation:

- The script should print `hello, world` (underscore, in the style of the first
  hello world implementation in the B programming language)
- Command line implementations only, unless explicitly impossible due to language
  constraints
- Unless it is absolutely, 100% necessary, do not use third party libraries or
  packages. Try to use standard libraries whenever possible.
- All submissions should have an appropriate `Makefile` to build the source
  (where applicable)
